Emoji Caesar Cipher: Documentation
What Does Each Letter Emoji Represent?

In this cipher, each letter of the alphabet (A-Z) is mapped to a specific emoji. These emojis serve as substitutes for letters when encrypting or decrypting messages. The emoji set used here is a simple 26-emoji array, one for each letter of the alphabet.

Example Mapping (A to Z):

A → 😀

B → 😃

C → 😄

D → 😁

E → 😆

F → 😅

G → 😂

H → 🤣

...

Z → 😲

Process of Encrypting a Message

Input Text: The user types a message using regular letters (A-Z).

Choose Shift: A shift value (1-25) is chosen. This determines how many positions the letters will be moved.

Encrypt:

Each letter in the message is replaced by its corresponding emoji, shifted by the chosen value.

For example, if the shift value is 3, "A" becomes "D" (shifted 3 positions), which corresponds to the emoji 😁.

Result: The encrypted message is displayed as a sequence of emojis.

Process of Decrypting a Message

Input Emoji Text: The user pastes a sequence of emojis.

Choose Shift: The same shift value used in encryption is applied.

Decrypt:

Each emoji is mapped back to the corresponding letter, shifted in the opposite direction (to reverse the encryption).

For example, if the emoji is 😁 (which represents "D"), a shift value of 3 would decrypt it to "A".

Result: The decrypted message is displayed as normal text.

Encryption and Decryption Example

Original Text: "HELLO"

Shift Value: 3

Encrypted Text: "🤣🤣🍎🍎🍎" (Using emojis corresponding to H, E, L, L, O after shifting by 3 positions)

Decrypted Text: "HELLO" (After reversing the shift by 3)
